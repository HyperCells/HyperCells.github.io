The HyperCells and HyperBloch packages provide a framwork for efficient modeling 
of tight-binding models on a broad list of hyperbolic lattices. We provide tutorials 
which are aimed to facilitate a smooth workflow and showcase prominent examples 
of interest.

* | `Supercells`_:
  
  The construction of tight-binding models on supercells enables access to higher-dimensional
  irreducible representations on the primitive cell without explicitly constructing them. In this tutorial, we will see
  how supercells and sequences of supercells are constructed. Two approaches are presented, which entail the construction
  of custom functions and subgroup tree graphs.
