Hyperbolic lattices were recently theoretically described by a non-Abelian generalization of the Bloch theorem, but practical approaches for efficient computations have remained missing. Our proposed **supercell method** overcomes the challenges posed by noncommuting translations, and enables significant progress towards an analytical description of hyperbolic lattice models in momentum space. Specifically, we use computational group theory to create a sequence of progressively larger unit cells, each formed as a symmetric aggregate of smaller unit cells. We apply the previously established Abelian hyperbolic band theory — which ignores the noncommutativity of translations — to those growing supercells and obtain a converging description of the infinite lattice.
