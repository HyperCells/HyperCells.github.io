Spectra of hyperbolic lattices were recently theoretically described by a non-Abelian generalization of the Bloch theorem, but practical approaches for efficient computations have remained missing. Our recently developed **supercell method** overcomes the challenges posed by noncommuting hyperbolic translations, and enables significant progress towards an analytical description of hyperbolic lattice models in momentum space. By leveraging computational group theory, we first generate a coherent sequence of progressively larger unit cells, each formed as a symmetric aggregate of smaller unit cells. Then, applying the formerly established Abelian hyperbolic band theory — which ignores the noncommutativity of translations — to the growing supercells, we obtain a convergent description of the spectrum of the infinite hyperbolic lattice.
